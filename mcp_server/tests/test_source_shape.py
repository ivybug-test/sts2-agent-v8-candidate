"""A ratchet on file size for the MCP sidecar.

The C# side has the same guard (`SourceShapeContractTests`) for the same reason: two files there
hold 49% of the mod, and neither got that way by a decision. This keeps the sidecar from repeating
it while it is still small enough to matter.

Budgets go down, never up. When a change needs more room than its budget allows, move something out
rather than raising the number -- raising one is a deliberate act that has to show up in the diff.
