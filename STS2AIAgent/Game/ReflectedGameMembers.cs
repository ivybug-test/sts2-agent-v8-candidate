/// <summary>What the mod reads out of the game that the compiler cannot check for it.</summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Everything else this mod touches is compile-checked: the project references the game's
/// <c>sts2.dll</c>, so a renamed public type or member turns the build red. The exception is the
/// private members below, which are found by name at runtime. Those fail differently -- and far
/// worse: <c>GetField</c> returns null, the call site falls back to a default, and an agent is told
/// <c>max_players: 0</c> with no way to tell that from a lobby that really holds nobody.
///
/// Slay the Spire 2 is in early access. A private field gets renamed in a patch and the mod keeps
/// answering, confidently, with numbers it invented. This registry is how that becomes visible:
/// every entry is resolved once when the mod loads, the misses are logged, and they are reported on
/// <c>GET /health</c>.
///
/// **It is also the only place those members are looked up.** Call sites ask <see cref="Field"/> or
/// <see cref="Method"/> for the member instead of calling <c>GetField</c> themselves. That is the
/// point, not a convenience: the first version of this registry resolved its own copy of each
/// member while the call sites resolved theirs, with their own binding flags, and the two could
/// disagree. They did -- <c>_longPressDuration</c> is static, the reader asked for an instance
/// field, and the probe would have reported <c>ready</c> the moment the registry was written
/// correctly while the reader went on falling back to a number it invented. One lookup, one set of
/// flags, and what the probe reports is what the mod actually gets.
///
/// The declaring type is a <c>typeof</c>, never a string, so getting a type wrong is a compile
/// error and only the member name -- the part that actually rots -- is text.
