/// A ratchet on file size, so the two monoliths stop growing.

/// <remarks>
/// Two files once held 49% of this mod's C# -- <c>GameStateService.cs</c> at 8.5k lines and
/// <c>GameActionService.cs</c> at 7k, against 31.6k in total across 82 files. Neither got there by a
/// decision; each grew by one more screen, one more action, one more predicate, and every one of
/// those additions was individually reasonable. That is how a codebase stops being navigable: not
/// through a bad commit, but through a thousand good ones with nothing counting.
///
/// This test counts. Every mod source file has a budget: <see cref="DefaultBudget"/> unless it
/// appears in <see cref="Budgets"/>, which lists the files already past it.
///
/// **Budgets go down, never up.** When a change needs more room than the budget allows, the answer
/// is to move something out of that file first, not to raise the number. Raising one is a
/// deliberate act that shows up in the diff and needs a reason in the commit message -- which is the
/// whole point, because nobody ever decided these two files should be this large.
///
/// Adding a *new* file to <see cref="Budgets"/> means declaring it a monolith. Prefer not to.
