/// Source-contract coverage for the two card viewers that draw the same visible card grid:
/// NCardLibrary (the deck / compendium viewer) and NCardPileScreen (a combat draw / discard /
/// exhaust pile). Both would otherwise fall through to the generic grid branch in
/// ResolveNonModalScreen and be reported as CARD_SELECTION, an action they deliberately do not
/// offer, and both were dead ends until their close paths were widened. GameStateService and
/// GameActionService are not linked into this project, so the branch ordering, the screen names,
/// the shared closable-viewer predicate, and the submenu-stack lookup are pinned from source in
/// the same shape as <see cref="RewardScreenContractTests"/> and
/// <see cref="DeckSelectionAvailabilityTests"/>.
