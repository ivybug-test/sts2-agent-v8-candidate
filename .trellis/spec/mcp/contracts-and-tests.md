# MCP Contracts and Tests

## Client transport contract

Follow the existing Python style: snake_case functions and variables, typed
parameters and returns, and explicit optional fields such as `int | None`.
Keep wire keys compatible with the mod. The client's `_request` method makes
the action replay boundary explicit:

```python
last_error: Sts2ApiError | None = None
retry_count = 0 if action_post else self._max_retries
attempts = 1 + retry_count
```

`Sts2ApiError` exposes `status_code`, `code`, `message`, `details`, and `retryable`. The client, `Sts2Client` in [client.py](../../../mcp_server/src/sts2_mcp/client.py), uses synchronous `urllib.request` transport; `iter_events` and `wait_for_event` are synchronous iterators/helpers as well.

Ordinary reads may retry according to the client retry settings. An action is a `POST /action` request and is never automatically replayed. If its response cannot be read, is not valid JSON, or violates the action envelope, the client returns `status: "outcome_unknown"`, marks the response as not stable, and performs at most one `GET /state` reconciliation. `Sts2Client._request` and `_reconcile_action_state_once` in [client.py](../../../mcp_server/src/sts2_mcp/client.py) are the source of truth.

Action responses must be JSON objects with a boolean `ok`. A failed envelope must contain an object `error` with a non-empty string `code`, a string `message`, and a boolean `retryable`; malformed envelopes are `invalid_response`. See `_decode_action_response_envelope` in [client.py](../../../mcp_server/src/sts2_mcp/client.py).

## Typed payload contract

Only two responses have a fixed, mod-declared field set: `/actions/available` and `/decisions`. Their models live in [payloads.py](../../../mcp_server/src/sts2_mcp/payloads.py), which owns validation, defaulting, the extension policy, and `PayloadSchemaError(path, expected, actual)`. Everything else stays a plain dict on purpose — a `/state` snapshot is screen-shaped, a game-data collection is heterogeneous, an SSE frame is whatever was published, and an action result may be a recovery payload; typing those would either infect every consumer or discard information.

The policy, so a new payload does not re-decide it:

- A field the mod always sends is required and type-checked. A wrong type is an error, never a coercion — and `bool` is rejected where a count belongs, because `True` is an `int` in Python.
- A field an older build may omit is optional with a documented default (`requires_*` flags default `False`). Absence is not corruption.
- Unknown fields are retained and re-emitted by `to_wire()`, matching the additive public contract (`additionalProperties: true` in `docs/openapi.json`).

`Sts2Client.get_action_catalog()` and `Sts2Client.get_decision_entries()` are the typed getters; `Sts2Client._parse_payload` converts a `PayloadSchemaError` into `Sts2ApiError(status_code=200, code="invalid_response", retryable=False, details=exc.as_details())`. They are **added beside** `get_available_actions()` / `get_decisions()`, which keep returning the raw JSON values so no existing caller, fake, or tool has to migrate mid-release. A null `/decisions` body is an error rather than an empty list: "no decisions were recorded" and "the response was unusable" are different claims.

Tests: [test_client_payloads.py](../../../mcp_server/tests/test_client_payloads.py) covers accepted and malformed payloads, the defaulting and extension policy, the transport seam (including that an error envelope still surfaces as the mod's own `Sts2ApiError`), and the legacy dict getters.

## Tool registration contract

`_normalize_tool_profile` in [server.py](../../../mcp_server/src/sts2_mcp/server.py) defaults to `guided`, maps `planner` and `multi-agent` to `layered`, and maps `legacy` to `full`.

- Base tools are registered for every profile.
- Planner, combat handoff, and knowledge tools are registered for `layered` and `full`.
- Legacy per-action tools are registered only for `full`.
- `run_console_command` is a separate debug tool enabled only when `STS2_ENABLE_DEBUG_ACTIONS` is truthy; it is deliberately excluded from compact `act`.

These gates live in `create_server` in [server.py](../../../mcp_server/src/sts2_mcp/server.py), which calls `_register_legacy_action_tools` for `full` and registers the debug tool only when `_debug_tools_enabled()`. Keep the public profile names and the debug boundary stable when changing the tool surface.

Tool functions are ordinary synchronous `def` functions. FastMCP's tool listing is asynchronous, so tests commonly call `asyncio.run(server.get_tool("..."))` and then invoke `tool.fn(...)`. `WaitBehaviorTests` in [test_waits.py](../../../mcp_server/tests/test_waits.py), `GameDataToolsTests` in [test_game_data_tools.py](../../../mcp_server/tests/test_game_data_tools.py) and `CrystalSphereToolTests` in [test_crystal_sphere_tools.py](../../../mcp_server/tests/test_crystal_sphere_tools.py) demonstrate this pattern.

## Test patterns

Use the standard library `unittest` runner used by the project. Prefer small fakes over a live game:

- A `DummyClient` with queued states verifies wait and tool behavior without HTTP; see `DummyClient` in [test_waits.py](../../../mcp_server/tests/test_waits.py).
- A `RecordingClient` verifies action arguments and call count; see `RecordingClient` in [test_crystal_sphere_tools.py](../../../mcp_server/tests/test_crystal_sphere_tools.py).
- Patch `_ensure_game_data_index` when testing game-data selection and normalization; see `GameDataToolsTests` in [test_game_data_tools.py](../../../mcp_server/tests/test_game_data_tools.py).
- Patch `request.urlopen` and `time.sleep` to verify transport outcomes. The replay-safety tests in [test_action_replay_safety.py](../../../mcp_server/tests/test_action_replay_safety.py) (for example `test_action_transport_failures_post_once_and_reconcile`) assert one action POST, no action retry, and one reconciliation GET for an ambiguous result.
- `NativeToolAlignmentTests` in [test_native_tool_alignment.py](../../../mcp_server/tests/test_native_tool_alignment.py) compares the Python guided surface with the C# native MCP surface. Update both sides deliberately when a guided tool changes.
- [test_client_payloads.py](../../../mcp_server/tests/test_client_payloads.py) is the typed-model pattern: pure parser tests plus one transport test per getter, patching `request.urlopen` with a minimal `JsonResponse` double.

## Dependency refresh checklist

`fastmcp` is a meta distribution: since 3.4.x the implementation ships in the `fastmcp-slim`
distribution declared as `fastmcp-slim[client,server]==<version>`, while the `fastmcp` wheel only
contributes an `__init__.py` and the dependency edges. An in-place upgrade in an existing venv can
therefore leave a `site-packages/fastmcp/` directory that still contains the previous release's
subpackages but no `__init__.py`, and `from fastmcp import FastMCP` then fails with
`cannot import name 'FastMCP' from 'fastmcp' (unknown location)`.

After `uv lock --upgrade-package`, force a clean reinstall of both distributions:

```powershell
Push-Location mcp_server
uv lock --upgrade-package fastmcp
uv sync --locked --reinstall-package fastmcp --reinstall-package fastmcp-slim
uv run --locked python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
Pop-Location
```

Note that `uv sync` prunes anything the lock does not declare, so an ad-hoc `uv pip install pytest`
does not survive it. The project's runner is `python -m unittest`, so that is not a supported need.

The security floors themselves are enforced by `python scripts/check_verification_gates.py`; raise a
floor in that script only together with the lock that satisfies it.


## Change checklist

- Preserve existing response fields and error names for compatibility.
- Test both success and malformed/error envelopes when changing decoding.
- Test action transport loss, unreadable responses, and reconciliation failure when changing action handling.
- Test each affected profile and debug gate when changing registration.
- Keep the test command and its working directory explicit: from the repository root, enter `mcp_server/` and run `uv run --locked python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`.
