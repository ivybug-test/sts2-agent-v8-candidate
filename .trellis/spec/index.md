# Project Specifications

STS2 AI Agent combines a C# Godot mod, an optional Python MCP server, and build/validation scripts. Choose the applicable layer in this single repository.

| Layer | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| [Mod](mod/index.md) | STS2AIAgent and the executable C# test harness |
| [MCP](mcp/index.md) | Python transport, tool profiles, and tests |
| [Operations](operations/index.md) | Builds, live validation, and releases |
| [Shared guides](guides/index.md) | Cross-layer checks and code reuse |

## Pre-Development Checklist

Read `AGENTS.md` (a local working file, deliberately untracked, which is why it is named rather than linked), then the applicable layer index and linked contracts. Source references and named symbols are the evidence for these guidelines. Consult shared guides before changing action/state contracts, tool surfaces, constants, or helpers. Check the [gameplay skill](../../skills/sts2-mcp-player/SKILL.md) when changing gameplay workflows.

## Quality Check

Follow layer checks and [validation guidance](operations/validation-and-release.md). For documentation-only changes, verify local links, index coverage, source claims, and removal of unfilled sections. Confirm discovery with `python ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages`. Runtime changes require the relevant build and gameplay checks.
