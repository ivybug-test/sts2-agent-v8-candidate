Event lookup by internal name and base type, plus per-option consequence and risk grading derived from the event sources.

## Event Index

`Layout` is the event layout the source declares (`Combat` events start a fight; `Ancient` is the
AncientEventModel default). `Options` counts the distinct options the source builds for the event,
and `HighestRisk` is the strongest risk tag among them.

## Option Risk Details

Every distinct option the event builds, in source order. `Option` is the option's localization key
without the `<EVENT>.pages.` prefix; options an Ancient creates through `RelicOption<T>` are
labelled after that helper instead of a literal key.

`Risk` is graded from the handler body and the option's own markers:

- `lethal-possible` - the source marks the option with `ThatDoesDamage`/`ThatWillKillPlayerIf`,
  so the game itself can treat the choice as fatal.
- `harmful` - the handler damages the player, burns Max HP, adds a curse, or takes a relic/potion.
- `costly` - the handler only spends Gold or removes/downgrades a card.
- `none-detected` - no harmful command was found in the handler body. This is an absence of
  evidence, not a guarantee.
- `locked` - the option has no handler and cannot be chosen.
- `unknown` - the handler could not be read from the source.

`Cost` and `Effect` only list what the handler body shows; `none detected` means nothing of
that kind was found, `?` means the amount is computed at runtime. `Continuation` records whether
choosing the option ends the event, leads to another page, or offers the same option again.
