## Review inventory

The PR conversation, reviews, inline review comments, review decision, and GraphQL review threads were fetched independently with `gh`/GitHub API before changing code.

- Issue comment `5477024283` is Sourcery's generated review guide, not an actionable finding by itself.
- Issue comment `5477024410` only reports exhausted Codex review credits and requires no code change.
- Review `5065465196` is `COMMENTED`; the PR has no blocking `reviewDecision` value.
- Two non-outdated, unresolved inline threads contained substantive findings:
  - `3893635933`: `continue_game_over` could complete while the native summary was still animating.
  - `3893635939`: semantic save verification compared JSON numbers by source spelling.

## Accepted findings and fixes

### Native game-over summary readiness

The finding was valid. `WaitForGameOverSummaryStartAsync` treated the Continue button becoming disabled as success, but the same state payload identifies that interval as `summary_animating`. Button disablement is the start of the native transition, not proof that score, unlock, and save processing is ready.

The wait is now named `WaitForGameOverSummaryReadyAsync` and succeeds only when either:

- the original game-over screen is gone, or
- the native Main Menu button is visible and enabled through `CanReturnToMainMenu`, which is the existing `summary_ready` gate.

`GameOver.SummaryReady` prevents reintroducing `CanContinueGameOver` as a completion predicate.

### Semantic JSON number comparison

The finding was valid. `JsonElement.GetRawText()` makes `1`, `1.0`, and `1e0` different strings even though they represent the same JSON number.

Number comparison now uses exact `decimal` values when possible, then finite `double` values as a fallback. Non-finite fallback values are rejected rather than allowing two overflows to compare equal. `GameOver.SaveEquivalentNumbers` covers integer, decimal, and exponent spellings.

## Verification

- `dotnet run --project STS2AIAgent.Tests/STS2AIAgent.Tests.csproj`: 62/62 passed.
- `mcp_server/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: 48/48 passed.
- `dotnet build STS2AIAgent/STS2AIAgent.csproj --no-restore /p:Sts2DataDir=<local game data directory>`: succeeded with 0 warnings and 0 errors.

The first bare build attempt used the project's default Steam location and therefore could not resolve `sts2`, `0Harmony`, or `GodotSharp` on this machine. Supplying the installed game's `Sts2DataDir` verified the actual project compile; the initial failure was environmental, not a source failure.

## Lessons

- A control becoming disabled is often a transition-start signal. Action completion must use the destination state's readiness contract.
- "Semantic JSON" requires semantic scalar comparison too; ignoring object order and whitespace is insufficient if numeric spelling remains textual.
- Source-contract tests are useful for Godot-facing behavior, but the main project should also be compiled against the local game assemblies after changing runtime services.
